    question: 'What is Send Me Builders?',
    answer: 'Send Me Builders is a faith-based organization that bridges the gap between housing needs, skilled trades, and spiritual truth. We work with faith-based organizations to establish community outposts in manufactured homes and apartments, where youth leaders live and mentor local youth through trades training, creating pathways to meaningful careers while nurturing spiritual growth.',

    question: 'How does the outpost model work?',
    answer: "Our model has four key steps: 1) A faith-based organization acquires a manufactured home in a high-need community; 2) Send Me Builders negotiates and mentors the rehabilitation process; 3) A youth leader moves into the rehabilitated home, establishing an 'Outpost'; 4) Youth and mentors work together on projects, learning trades skills while building relationships centered on faith and character development.",

    question: 'How can my faith-based organization become a partner?',
